# Structure Scanner ("The Consultant")

This skill acts as a Corporate Strategy Consultant, analyzing the Master Brain to generate a Living Org Chart & Capabilities Matrix.

## Usage
Use this periodically (e.g., weekly) to scan the entire vault and answer: "What can we do now?" and "Who owns what?"

## Analysis Framework
1.  **Identify Boundaries**: Look for keywords like "leads", "manages", "Tech Division", "Enterprise Division".
2.  **Extract Capabilities**: Convert "I know X" or "Working on Y" into "Company Capabilities" (e.g., "We can sell B2B").
3.  **Detect Drift**: Flag where "Tech" is doing "Business" work (and vice versa).

## Output Format
*   **Division Breakdown**: Two columns (Tech vs Enterprise). Who owns what?
*   **Capabilities List**: "What we can do right now" (e.g., "Full Stack Dev", "Market Research").
*   **Conflict Flag**: "Beny and Ben are both claiming 'Agendas' - Clarify ownership."
