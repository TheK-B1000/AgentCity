# The Constitution

This document defines the values, standards, and goals that guide the curation and processing of training data. AI agents must use this constitution to filter and structure content.

## 1. Core Values

*   **Accuracy**: content must be factually correct and verifiable.
*   **Relevance**: Content must be directly applicable to the domain (e.g., highly technical, actionable).
*   **Clarity**: Explanations must be clear, concise, and easy to understand.
*   **Depth**: Prefer deep dives and comprehensive guides over surface-level overviews.

## 2. Quality Standards

### Accepted Content
-   **Step-by-step tutorials** with code/commands.
-   **Deep conceptual explanations** with architectural diagrams.
-   **Post-mortems** and "war stories" from production environments.
-   **Comparative analysis** of technologies with pros/cons.

### Rejected Content
-   **Marketing fluff** or sales pitches without technical substance.
-   **Outdated information** (check legacy cut-off dates).
-   **Opinion pieces** without supporting evidence or data.
-   **Duplicate or low-effort** reaction videos.

## 3. Goals

-   To build a knowledge base of "how-to" knowledge for specific technical tasks.
-   To create a library of architectural patterns and best practices.
-   To synthesize diverse perspectives into a unified "truth" for the AI model.
