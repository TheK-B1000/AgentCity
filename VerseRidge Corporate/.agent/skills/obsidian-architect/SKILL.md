# Obsidian Architect

This skill guides the creation of documentation that mimics the user's specific "VerseRidge" Obsidian style: high-depth, indentation-heavy, and category-driven.

## Usage
Use this skill when the user asks to "document well" or "make a master file" of their scattered notes.

## The Style Guide ("VerseRidge Format")
1.  **Depth over Breadth**: Do not summarize. If a point has a sub-point, indent it. If that sub-point has a nuance, indent again.
2.  **Indentation**: Use Tab-like indentation (4 spaces).
3.  **No Prose Blocks**: Avoid long paragraphs. Break everything down into atomic bullets.
4.  **Flow**:
    *   **Level 1**: Major Category (e.g., "Team Dynamics")
    *   **Level 2**: Sub-Category (e.g., "Beny")
    *   **Level 3**: Item (e.g., "Role Definition")
    *   **Level 4**: Detail (e.g., "Focus on Enterprise/Ops")
    *   **Level 5**: Nuance/Quote (e.g., "Felt previous equity split was unfair")

## Example Output
```markdown

    Beny
