# AI Agent Market Research: From Casual to Fortune 500

## 2. Small to Medium Business (The "Efficiency" Layer)
SMBs are deploying agents to handle specific business functions without overhead:
- **Sales & Marketing**: Automation of lead nurturing and pricing optimization.
- **Customer Support**: Use of specialized agents (e.g., Helply, Intercom) to reduce ticket volumes by up to 50%.

## 3. Fortune 500 & Enterprise (The "Strategic" Layer)
Large corporations use agents to manage scale and complexity:
- **JPMorgan Chase (COIN)**: Automates the review of thousands of legal contracts, reducing legal work hours significantly.
- **Oracle**: AI agents for automated expense report review and approval.
- **McDonald's/Coca-Cola**: Predictive inventory management and drive-thru accuracy improvements.

## 4. Big Tech Deep-Dive (The "Architectural" Layer)
Big tech firms are the most advanced, using agents for core operations:
- **Google (Gemini/Agentspace)**: Building ecosystems where agents interact across different apps to fulfill complex objectives.
- **Microsoft (Copilot/AutoGen)**: Moving towards proactive agents that manage IT help desks and corporate workflows autonomously.

## 5. Convergence & Future Trends
- **SQL-First Agency**: Shifting from text responses to direct database interaction (e.g., Salesforce Horizon, Uber Finch).
