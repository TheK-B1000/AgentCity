# Hybrid Ownership Structures Technical Brief

This document outlines 5 unique ownership structures combining elements of steward-ownership, DAOs, and traditional cooperatives, generated specifically to prioritize mission-locked sustainability.

---

### 1. The Veto-Token DAO (The "Golden Share" Protocol)
- **Concept**: DAOs + Steward-Ownership.
- **Mechanism**: Day-to-day operations are handled via DAO voting. However, a "Golden Share" is held by a non-profit foundation.
- **Benefit**: Protects against hostels takeovers or "mission drift" by allowing the foundation to veto decisions that violate core values.

### 2. The Algorithmic Common Ownership Enterprise
- **Concept**: Cooperatives + Smart Contracts.
- **Mechanism**: Digitzes the "asset lock". Surplus profits are automatically distributed by an immutable contract (e.g., 70% to reserves, 20% to members).
- **Benefit**: Prevents demutualization and ensures the cooperative remains focused on its community rather than individual member payouts.

### 3. The Reputation-Weighted Stewardship Trust
- **Concept**: Purpose Trusts + Earned Governance.
- **Mechanism**: A Purpose Trust owns the assets, but a DAO acts as the enforcer. Voting power is earned via "Reputation" tokens (based on labor/contribution) rather than capital.
- **Benefit**: Ensures that those doing the work have the most say, decoupling control from financial wealth.

### 4. The Federated DAO League
- **Concept**: Cooperative Leagues + DAO Treasuries.
- **Mechanism**: Small steward-owned firms federate into a larger DAO. The DAO manages a shared treasury for financial resilience.
- **Benefit**: Allows small firms to scale their influence and resilience while maintaining local, independent autonomy.

### 5. The Smart-Contract Transition Mortgage
- **Concept**: Traditional Buyouts + Progressive Decentralization.
- **Mechanism**: Retiring owners are paid via a profit-pegged smart contract "mortgage". As debt is paid, governance shifts to a worker-based DAO.
- **Benefit**: Provides a clear, low-friction exit for founders while ensuring a sustainable transition to worker stewardship.
