# VerseRidge Obsidian Export



# Source: 2025-12-09.md
Today Beny and I are having a conversation about next steps and revival.
	Notes:	
		K-B wants a developer role
		Disbanding
			Not just the last meeting about ownership
			Me not doing activities
		What we can do differently
			Ben can step in when delegating and assign self as much if not more than the others
			Routines, structures regarding workflows
			More serious, regular meetings, sticking to agenda
			Consistency in schedule, focus and serious on meetings
				Set up meetings for consistency and plan 2-3 weeks in advance
		Avoid over-reliance on APIs/ other AIs
		Specific research documentation
	Questions:
		What do you hope to accomplish with VRT2?
			Been thinking about working a 9-5 and it is not intriguing.
			Wants to develop something separate from 9-5 for financial freedom
			Diversified income
			Provide a useful service wanted B2B and local
			She likes my AI ideas
			Stand-outs from oversaturated
		How have you changed since last time?
			(on the backburner)
		How are you hoping I have changed?
			She hopes that I am taking charge in what everybody is doing
				Join somebody when they are starting something I have delegated
			Beny feels I gave her good direction but not so much the others
			The team felt me starting with a high share and them working hard to earn it felt unfair
		How do you hope the team has/will change?
			A system where all partners feel they are getting a proper lion's share of profits/stocks
			Reapproach how we structure ownership
			Corey will have new insights from his big fancy industry job
		Why are things going to be different this time?
			I seem more serious
				Seeing me that way is motivating to others
			Beny will bring her best foot forward (right one)
				Very important we can agree on shares
			Define roles well and emphasis professional development
			(backburner)
		Did your old role at VRT make sense to you? Do you think we can setup better communication infrastructure? 
			Beny is on the fence about her role. 
			Her role was better defined than Corey and K-B's
			Thinks role is a good fit
			She wants to see if her skills could be better utilized in a different way
		Miscommunication about time today
	Questions from Beny:
		Are we creating an AI to help with programming problems?
			If that works, otherwise we may need to take a more manual approach on people's programs
	Gauge Beny's interest in the following:
		Education 5-6
		AI externality accounting 7-8
		Tech consulting 7
		Synthesizing new insights given massive AI data (remain open minded) 7
		(More job infrastructure for humans) Investigating what makes us human and how to perpetuate those types of jobs for educated people 8
		E-commerce and trading card market 6
		Media 5
		Government Contracting

Ben and K-B morning meeting:
	K-B wants to have a lot of solo work
	Likes for us to all have a share, all working
		Go from there
	K-B's priority is being able to pickup tickets
	Wants to avoid structural meeting
	One weekly meeting
	One work session
	He's very busy
	Hands off with sales, clients, business documents
	His focus is back-end, research, AI, diagrams
	Once we find an aim, try to get our first client	
	Certain things need to be done before certain meetings
		i.e bank account setup before we add a technical task
	Minimize set-up and cost
	Prepare for a Google Geeni world
	K-B in charge of research templating
	Ben having final say, but not the 100% owner, not just HIS baby
	K-B and I like to get off task during business meetings
	Work session vs meeting
		Meetings less than an hour

Ben and Corey's evening meeting

	2 and 2 idea
		<-B-B-T-T->
		Corey scrum-master
	Shares
		What involvement does Corey want in this decision?
		What kinds of minimum involvement should people have to continue to grow their shares?
			Example: each month worked an average of 20 hours a week consistently gives 5 shares (each one being worth like an appropriately % of the company)
		Profit-sharing
			3% of the company is the business hits certain thresholds those responsible gain a bonus 
	Policy related to internal tech use, research and documenting
		First project assigned with K-B

		Over time we figure out what we are willing to handle
		Keep our heads when the business gets big, what its like being the little guy
		Standard structure
		Being treated like an adult "you know your job and how to do it, so do it and we all get along"
	Misc
		6:30 meeting times for Corey
		Variety of goals
		Both Corey and Ben can come to the next (Wednesday) meeting with ideas about what structure should be setup first

# Source: 2025-12-16.md
I want the VRT2 to work on something together right away and deligate different parts of it to different members just to get back into the swing of it and use it as a test of our work flows. The best way to find the best system is testing so we should start something lowstakes like a YouTube channel, Instagram, Facebook or some other type of organization

We need to deeply verify and research our favorite sources for information and come up with a good system to extract the info and site our extractions.

	Corey notes
		Main issues
			Pay
			Ownership
				Unvested shares return to company if someone leaves
				Vested shares do not transfer
				Company has first right to buyback shares
				Compensation Pool
				Profit Sharing
				Profitability thresholds
					Determine when to start taking payouts
				No monthly pay changes
					Only change via milestones
					annual review
					supermajority
			Shares
				If vested
					Can only sell shares after a certain period
				If not vested
					Offer buyback for a reduced price or forfeit those shares 
		Really strong set of rules for decision making
		Beny's take
			Avoiding supermajority good
				Avoiding having issues we had last time
			Vested Shares
				Minimum amount of hours concern
					What tasks take what hours? What are they worth?
				Likes the idea a lot
			Try to have the most equal footing
				We can all be at peace with whats going on in the company
			Resolution for weight of harder work
			K-B reaches his minimum hourly quicker
			Some tasks are more or less intense
				Define an hour and some tasks worth 1.3 hours per hour or 0.7 hours per hour
				OR separate salary or base pay for doing harder work
				Define what is considered "working an hour"
	Beny's notes
		Goal
			Long term scalable
			We can all be part of
			Fair, flexible
			Protect founders
		Main points
			All of us start 5% or 10% equity making us all equal
			More shared responsibility
			Vested over time
				Gradually earning it with continued contribution to the company
				3 or 4 years the equity is given over time
				This would make sure everybody is an active member
			Remaining 60% would remain in the company
				Reinvesting trying to make the company better

		Longevity
		Equivalent to Database Standardizations

# Source: 2026-01-23.md
K-B unveiling his research
	Education AI Employment Gap/App Vision
		What can we do to help bridge the gap between school and work
			Especially AI
			Work flows from companies
		Focus on an ease of transitioning to a company by practicing those skills
		Weekly report on how you're doing on coding and mock-interviews
		Audience
			Traditional CS students
			Little mentorship
			Self taught
		Tutorials
			Didn't fill in the gaps enough
				Surface level understanding without deeper, personalized skill-transference
			Leetcode
				doesn't fit into AI work
				Helps mechanics only, hard if self guided
		Our service
			Gives flashcards
			15 programming patterns (leetcode)
		What do students want?
			mentor-like guide
			feedback on thinking
			Context for why things (in coding) matter
			Realistic coding environment/simulation
		Business
			Software Engineer Bridge gap
				Real world framing
				Feedback loops
				Industry simulations
			Research questions
				Where are the tools at
				What can we learn from that
		Today’s tools are fragmented: - need to be brought all together
			Chatbots explain concepts
			IDEs let you write code
			Courses teach theory
			LeetCode trains interviews
			Tutorials show isolated examples
			Vibe coding
		Combines
			Explanation
			Practice
			Feedback
			Progression
			Mentorship
			Realistic Systems
			Vibe coding App
			Daily tasks and challenges like duolingo
		Simulated Professional Scenarios
		NotebookLM-Style Understanding

			Can summarize a 10 hour lecture in 10 minutes
		Replit-style coding environment
			Run, test and debug endlessly
			Agentic-like repetition
			Do things beyond a hw assignment, imitate real life
		Notes in layers, starting with just what you're learning, more detail on specifics when expanded upon
		Contextual Leet-code drills
			Daily Programming pattern practice
			Context
			15 programming patterns
				Practice all of them
				interview style problems
				Focus on approach and critical thinking
		!!Real-world simulations!!
			Mentorship and Simulated professional environments
				Fallback on AI mentorship
				Coach like
			Every aspect is immitated from the real world, managers, work-flows
			Incomplete, messy real-world problems
			Research needed on completion
			Assign users positions and roles that are realistic, more so than school environments
			Vibe coding simulations that are
				in depth
				Tackle common vibe code issues 
			Corey's work has
				sub-parts and jobs that he didn't know existed
				Simulated environments include roles that often are not shown clearly in school
				Even coding job isn't 8 hours a day
				Most of the day is researching, coding, meetings
			Random Changes by the client last second simulation
		Vibe-coding trap
			If you dont know what you're looking at and copy-paste from AI
				it breaks
		Success
			Understanding day-to-day work
			How classroom knowledge applies
			Interview improvements
			Less confusion going into jobs
			Sort of like our senior project
		The app does not optimize for
			Course completion
			Certs
			Memorization
		Next Research Steps
			What Boot.dev and DataAnnotation do
			Stick to concepts (15 Programming Patterns)
			Focus on one part at a time
			Current companies simulating the workforce

VW-EAS
	# VW-EAS (Equity Split Term)
		**VW-EAS = Vested-Weighted – Employee Allocation Split**
		It describes a **two-layer equity split framework** that:
			1. **Weights founder ownership by vesting status (VW)**
			2. **Separately allocates an employee equity pool (EAS)**
		This structure is used to **fairly distribute equity among founders and employees based on contribution, time, and risk.**
